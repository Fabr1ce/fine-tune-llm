{"instruction": "Explain AMD GPUs to a 10 year old", "output": "AMD GPUs are special computer chips that help make games look really pretty and run smoothly! Think of them like super-fast artists that can draw thousands of pictures every second. They're made by a company called AMD, and they compete with another company called NVIDIA to make the best graphics cards."}
{"instruction": "What is ROCm?", "output": "ROCm (Radeon Open Compute) is AMD's open-source software platform for GPU computing. It allows developers to run high-performance computing applications on AMD GPUs, similar to how CUDA works for NVIDIA GPUs."}
{"instruction": "How does LoRA fine-tuning work?", "output": "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is an efficient fine-tuning method that adds small trainable matrices to existing model layers instead of updating all parameters. This dramatically reduces memory usage and training time while maintaining performance."}
